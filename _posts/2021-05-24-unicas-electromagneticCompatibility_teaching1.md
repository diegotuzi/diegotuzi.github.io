#### Teaching activity for ""Electromagnetic Compatibility: Modelling and Measurements" course
##### University of Cassino and Southern Lazio

At the end of my master degree thesis, I introduced my thesis work to students of the course "Electromagnetic Compatibility: Modelling and Measurements" held by Prof. Domenico Capriglione during the Academic Year 2020/2021. It was an interesting experience and I was really happy to explain my thesis work and to answer to the student's questions.
