#### Course Project for "Internet of Things"
##### Politecnico di Milano - Academic Year 2010/2011

As a student of Politecnico di Milano, I and other teammate developed this project inside the master course "Internet of Things" held by Prof. Matteo Cesana.
The project has two implementations. The first implementation is with MoteRunner software while the second one is a TinyOS software. The project is a network simulator for an IoT network.
