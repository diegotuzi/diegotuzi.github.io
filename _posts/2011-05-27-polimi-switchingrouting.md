#### Course Project for "Switching and Routing"
##### Politecnico di Milano - Academic Year 2011/2012

As a student of Politecnico di Milano, I and other teammates developed this project inside the master course "Switching and Routing" held by Prof. Achille Pattavina.
The project is a C++ software. It simulates a non-blocking switching network with a variable number of input and output. It has the possibility to test different switching algorithms.
