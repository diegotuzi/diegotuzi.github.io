#### Teaching activity for "Switching and Routing" course
##### Politecnico di Milano - Academic Year 2013/2014

As a student and graduand of Politecnico di Milano, I gave a seminar about the C++ network simulator that I developed for the master course "Switching and Routing" held by Prof. Achille Pattavina during the Academic Year 2010/2011. I gave the seminar to the Switching and Routing's students during the Academic Year 2013/2014.
It was an interesting experience and I was really happy to explain my work and to answer to the student's questions.
