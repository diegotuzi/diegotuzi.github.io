#### Collaboration with Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria (DEIB)
##### Politecnico di Milano - Academic Year 2013/2014

As a student and graduand of Politecnico di Milano, I started a collaboration with Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria (DEIB) and in particular with Prof. Guido Maier. 
This work was carried out in the context of a national project called ““Rete Ottica di Accesso e Divisione di frequenza e/o di lunghezza d’onda per soluzioni Next Generation Network (ROAD-NGN)”. My contribution was about a cost-effective deployment of the optical access network for broadband operators. In particular I proposed a technique to perform the Unbundling in the Local Loop (ULL) when Passive Optical Networks (PONs) are deployed in the access.
I worked on this project from April 2013 to February 2014.  My final goal was to use this project to realize my master degree thesis at Politecnico di Milano. Unfortunately for personal reasons I couldn’t conclude my master degree at Politecnico di Milano.
Despite that, I enjoyed that time. Thanks to DEIB and in particular to Prof. Guido Maier, I acquired some useful skills regarding the scientific production. I realized several documents but I hadn’t the opportunity to publish the outcome of my work on a scientific magazine.
