#### Course Project for "Antennas and Radiowave Propagation"
##### University of Cassino and Southern Lazio - Academic Year 2018/2019

As a student of University of Cassino and Southern Lazio, I realized this project inside the master course "Antennas and Radiowave Propagation" held by Prof. M.D. Migliore.
The project is a “Coil Antenna design” using the Feko software.
