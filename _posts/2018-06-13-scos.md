### Course Project for "Instrumentation and Measurements for Communication Systems" - Prof. Gianfranco Miele
#### University of Cassino and Southern Lazio - Academic Year 2018

As a student of University of Cassino and Southern Lazio, I and other teammates developed this project inside the master course "Instrumentation and Measurements for Communication Systems" held by Prof. Gianfranco Miele.
The project is a “Spectrum Characterization and Occupancy Sensing (SCOS)” application. It uses an Ettus USRP E310 KIT (SDR development kit) controlled by GnuRadio and Matlab.
