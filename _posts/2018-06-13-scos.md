### Course Project for "Instrumentation and Measurements for Communication Systems" - Prof. Gianfranco Miele
#### University of Cassino and Southern Lazio - Academic Year 2018

As a student of University of Cassino and Southern Lazio, I and other teammates developed this project inside the master course "Instrumentation and Measurements for Communication Systems" held by Prof. Gianfranco Miele.
The project is a “Spectrum Characterization and Occupancy Sensing (SCOS)” application. It uses two of Ettus USRP E310 (embedded SDR)) controlled by GNU Radio and Matlab.

Acquired and consolidated skylls:
* [GNU Radio](https://www.gnuradio.org/)
* Software Defined Radio (SDR)
* [Ettus USRP E310](https://www.ettus.com/all-products/e310/)
* [Matlab](https://matlab.mathworks.com/)

Documents:
* [SCOS User Manual](/assets/pdf/2018-06-03_scos_user_manual.pdf).
