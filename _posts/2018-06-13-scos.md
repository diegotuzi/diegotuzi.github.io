### Course Project for "Instrumentation and Measurements for Communication Systems" - Prof. Gianfranco Miele
#### University of Cassino and Southern Lazio - Academic Year 2018

As a student of University of Cassino and Southern Lazio, I and other teammates developed this project inside the master course "Instrumentation and Measurements for Communication Systems" held by Prof. Gianfranco Miele.
The project is a “Spectrum Characterization and Occupancy Sensing (SCOS)” application. It uses an Ettus USRP E310 KIT (SDR development kit) controlled by GNU Radio and Matlab.

Documents:
* [Scos User Manual](/assets/pdf/20180603_scos_user_manual.pdf).

Acquired and consolidated skylls:
* GNU Radio
* SDR
* Ettus USRP E310
* Matlab
