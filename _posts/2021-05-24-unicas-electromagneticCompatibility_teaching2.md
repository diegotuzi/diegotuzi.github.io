#### Teaching activity for "Electromagnetic Compatibility: Modelling and Measurements" course
##### University of Cassino and Southern Lazio

At the end of my master degree thesis, I organized and conducted a little seminar on "EMF Human Exposure Measurements and Previsional Calculation for wireless systems". I gave the seminar to "Electromagnetic Compatibility: Modelling and Measurements" students. I gave the seminar during the Academic Year 2020/2021. It was an interesting experience and I was really happy to explain part of my job and to answer to the student's questions.
