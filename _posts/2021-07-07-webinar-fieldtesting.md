#### Keysight Technologies Digital Event

I attended the Webinar "Field Testing at Millimeter-Wave with Wideband Analysis". Adesh Jain held the webinar. He is an Application Engineer inside RF&Microwave department at Keysight Technologies.
Thanks to this webinar I had on overview of Field Testing at Millimeter-Wave Wideband Analysis. Keysight developed a Fieldfox analyser able to detect signal up to 54 GHz and with 120 MHz bandwidth. It can be used in radar, satellite and 5GNR applications.
