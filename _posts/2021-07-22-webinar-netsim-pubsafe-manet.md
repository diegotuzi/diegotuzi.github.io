#### Keysight Technologies Digital Event

I attended the Webinar "Network simulation for public safety MANET Radios". Vishal Gupta held the webinar. He is a Segment Manager (India) and Solutions Architect at Keysight Technologies.
Thanks to this webinar I had on overview about MANET network testing. It was really interesting the common approaches for channel modeling.
