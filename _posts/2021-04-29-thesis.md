As a student of University of Cassino and Southern Lazio, I ended my educational path with a thesis work entitled "4G and 5G control signals: Stability analysis". I worked on the thesis for 8 months. I started with an extensive research part followed by an experimental part. I, my Supervisor and my Co-Supervisors had several meetings during the work to address the activities.

It was an amazing experience. I'm very thankful to the Supervisors for received support and the availability during the thesis work.
