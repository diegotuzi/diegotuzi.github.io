#### Course Project for "Localization Navigation and Smart Mobility"
##### Politecnico di Milano - Academic Year 2011/2012

As a student of Politecnico di Milano, I and other teammates developed this project inside the master course "Localization Navigation and Smart Mobility" held by Prof. Monica Nicoli.
The project is an Android application. It estimates the distance between mobile terminals doing bluetooth measurements.
