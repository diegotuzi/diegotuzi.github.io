#### Course Project for "Advanced topics on Audio and Video processing"
##### Politecnico di Milano - Academic Year 2011/2012

As a student of Politecnico di Milano, I and other teammate developed this project inside the master course "Advanced topics on Audio and Video processing" held by Prof. Augusto Sarti.
The project is a Matlab GUI software. It estimates the room impulse response.
