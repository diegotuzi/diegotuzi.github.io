Welcome to my Website. Iâ€™m Diego Tuzi an enthusiastic guy who loves digital technologies. I am an Engineer with a bachelor and a master degree in Telecommunications. I'm also a licenced professional Italian Engineer (since 2021) and a licenced Italian Journalist (since 2008). 
This Website is just a way to practice my writing skylls in different languages. I'm not only referring to human languages such as Italian or English but I'm also referring to computer languages. For example, what you're reading right now is written using [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). 
I've been studying English, I'm quite good but not perfect. If you find a mistake, I'll be happy to receive your feedback.

Inside this website you can find:
* [Blog section](blog.html): It contains several interesting posts about my academic and personal activities;
* Resume section: It contains an updated version of my Resume in [English](resume.html) and in [Italian](resume_ita.html);
* [Changelog section](changelog.html): It's a log section where I'm going to track all the structural updates about this website.
